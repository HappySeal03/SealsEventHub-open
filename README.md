# Source code for a webapp to handle events
---

### What is this project?
This is a simple webapp meant for simplifying event hosting for small communities.  
**This Project is still in developement**: it has been published already to share progress with the community I'm building this for

### What will the final version offer?
The goal for this webapp is to let users create channels they can use to post events in. Other users will be able to subscribe to specific channels to see and sign up for events. Users will also be able to create and manage teams for joining tournaments. A permission system will be in place to restrict access to certain operations such as editing events.

### What is the scope of this project?
This is just a project made for fun by a computer science student so don't expect anything incredible :\)
